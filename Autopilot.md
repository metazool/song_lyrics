```
You're on autopilot
Whisper and you'll deny it 
Cause you're on autopilot
Never an empty moment

We're on autopilot
Souls in a parking lot 
Shunted from space to space
Never stopping in one place

I'm on autopilot
Tryna break it, tryna escape it
Maybe i'll make it 
Maybe we'll make it 

Fly free with me, baby
Fly with me and find out 
If we're still on autopilot
Let's fuck around and find out
who we are in the cockpit
It's tough shit, we're right in it

All on autopilot
In a parking lot
with only one space
Face to face to face
```
