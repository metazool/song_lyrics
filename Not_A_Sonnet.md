My heart is open. That is all there is to it.
It opened to allow you to pass through it
And now it's stuck like this, and you're stuck in it.
I'm inhabited by the world that we inhabit 
together; a universe held here by force of habit
and hope eternal that i'll rediscover you in it.
Iterable or absolute, so simple there's nothing to it;
your shape in space spring there before i knew it.

To turn back would take another eternity, to undo it
Would consume another universe with wrong, it
matters what we do, only in matter i can confirm you
here, and i, ourselves, at our most kind, most true.
These are definitely some song lyrics and not a sonnet;
my heart is open, that is all there is to it.
